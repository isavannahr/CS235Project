#Does an increase in gun laws have an effect on the amount of gun violence in the US?
Given gun violence and gun control data from the United States we will use association, 
clustering, sequential patterns and outlier detection to determine whether the number of gun 
control laws in a state has an effect on gun violence. 

With the prevalence of gun violence in the United States and the diversity of gun laws amongst
individual states, we seek to to determine if the number of gun provisions within a state has 
an effect on gun violence. Federal law grants states the freedom to augment federal gun 
regulations with their own, leading different states to have different levels of 
regulations (McClenathan, Pahn, & Siegel, 2016, pg iv). This allows us to use datasets with 
information on state specific gun regulations in conjunction with data sets on gun violence for
each state to determine if there is a correlation between gun laws and gun violence in this 
country.
